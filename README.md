The UsagiShima (Bunny Island) follows those rules : 
- Each bunny needs at least one carrot.
- If there are not enough carrot, bunnies leave the island (cells are deactivated) until there are enough carrots for everyone.
- When a bunny leaves the island, it take its terrier with it. The terrier cell must then be deactivated.
- To gather carrots, the island needs carrot shops. For each lap, a single carrot shop generates 3 carrots. The carrot shop number is constant, but you can create some new rules to make it dynamic (bonus)
- At each lap, bunnies must try to move. A bunny can move if there is at least one neighbor that is not occupied (that imply diagonal neighbors).
- A board is generated by a seed. For each
- The game stops when the board is full or when currentLap == laps.
